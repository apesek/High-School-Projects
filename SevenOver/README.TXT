1.) I chose to make this project because of a game me and my friends sometimes play called 7-Over. One
of those friends used his basic knowledge of programing to create a simple command-promt version of the
game, so I decided to take it to the next level and make a version of my own.

2.) The most challenging part was trying to fix bugs in the game that would ruin the gameplay, such as
a bug that allowed the user to bet as much money as they wanted, so if the roll was 7-over, they'd get
double that back. There were also several problems that caused the gamble to reset back to zero.

3.) -Frustration: 6
    -Satisfaction: 7
    -Difficulty: 6
    -Enjoyment:8
    
4.) I would want to try to add more upgrades, that would do more unique things. I would also want add bonus 
rounds that have you play some kind of mini-game to get more money.
